# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company and builds predictive models to identify at-risk customers.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:
- Analyze customer churn patterns
- Identify key factors influencing churn
- Build machine learning models to predict churn
- Provide actionable insights for customer retention

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about telecom customers including:
- Customer demographics (gender, age, partner, dependents)
- Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Services (phone, internet, streaming services)
- Charges (monthly and total charges)
- Churn status (target variable)

## Features

### Data Preparation
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset
- Handles missing values
- Encodes categorical variables
- Prepares data for machine learning

### Data Splitting
- Splits data into 80% training and 20% testing sets
- Ensures representative distribution of churn cases

### Feature Selection
- Identifies most important features using Random Forest
- Selects top 10 features for model training
- Provides feature importance visualization

### Model Selection & Training
- Tests multiple algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Trains models on selected features

### Model Evaluation
- Comprehensive performance metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix analysis
- ROC curve visualization
- Model comparison charts

### Business Insights
- Analyzes churn patterns by contract type
- Examines tenure-based churn rates
- Provides actionable recommendations

## Installation

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the complete analysis:
```bash
python customer_churn_analysis.py
```

The script will:
1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Split data into training/testing sets
3. Select important features
4. Train multiple models
5. Evaluate and compare models
6. Generate visualizations
7. Provide business insights

## Output

The script generates multiple visualization files:

- **Churn Rate**: 26.54% of customers churn
- **Key Risk Factors**:
  - Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate (42.7%)
  - Customers with tenure less than 12 months are at higher risk (47.7% churn rate)
  - High monthly charges correlate with increased churn
- **Top Important Features**:
  - TotalCharges (18.7% importance)
  - MonthlyCharges (17.9% importance) 
  - Tenure (15.4% importance)
  - Contract type (8.0% importance)
